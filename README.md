Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud-based services. Launched by Amazon in 2006, AWS empowers businesses, developers, and individuals to build, deploy, and manage applications without needing to maintain physical infrastructure.

AWS offers over 200 fully-featured services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, networking, and content delivery.

These tools enable users to create applications tailored to their specific needs while benefiting from global accessibility and high availability.

One of AWS's strengths lies in its flexibility, supporting various programming languages and integrating with a wide range of third-party tools. It operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to scale resources up or down based on demand, optimizing cost-efficiency.
